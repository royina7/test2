    <p class="lyrics">Guess there's something about it<br>
That I can't explain<br>
We could see other people<br>
But it's never the same<br>
You could be in Toronto<br>
And I could be in L.A<br>
And we could wait too long<br>
But it's never too late<br>
And if twenty years went by without you<br>
I'd know our feelings wouldn't change<br>
We've got that different kind of love<br>
That's stronger than the both of us<br>
No matter what<br>
We've got that different kind of love<br>
We've got that<br>
We don't have to talk<br>
To know this love will never stop<br>
No matter what<br>
We've got that different kind of love</p>
